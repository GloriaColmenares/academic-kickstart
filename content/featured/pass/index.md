abstract: We investigate technology as source of product differentiation on strategic behavior and wealth distribution in the German electricity market. We compare the performance of our model to a benchmark, using elasticity-adjusted markups, without bid data. We represent uncertainty on the demand side as intermittency of renewables or flexible demand response. We show that both model estimates converge at off-peak hours being robust to ramping cost and renewable forecast assumptions. Producers pass on fuel and CO$_2$ costs differently with implications for reinforced European Emissions Trading regulation. Consumers are better off under a carbon price floor of \euro{25}/tCO$_2$, but producers are worse off, particularly at morning peak.
